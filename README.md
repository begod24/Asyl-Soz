# 🎮 Asyl Söz 

*A mobile Unity game inspired by Doodle Jump and the Kazakh language*

---

## 🌤 About the Project

**Asyl Söz** is a lightweight 2D mobile platformer inspired by classic vertical jump games like *Doodle Jump*.  
Instead of collecting coins or power-ups, the player collects **Kazakh words** — turning movement into a calm and playful cultural experience.

The game is designed to introduce the Kazakh language **softly and intuitively**, without quizzes, pressure, or explicit lessons.

## ✨ Core Idea

Language is treated as something **alive and valuable**.

Words float in the air, appear on platforms, and are collected as the player moves upward.  
Even when the player falls, the words are not lost — they remain part of the journey.

This project explores how games can be used not to *teach*, but to help players **feel connected** to a language and culture.
